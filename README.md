Aa project that researches how to manage OMC components - their life cycle, relationships and CI/CD - as one platform.

#### Goals
 - Create a framework and a visualization (dashboard) to manage OMC components better as their number grows and things get out of hand
 - Facilitate better CI/CD through "natural" monitoring of usage of tools, adherence to processes and correctness of data.
