A component undergoes a life cycle, from inception to production delivery to BAU to end of life.  One way of tracking the component's life cycle is by monitoring events emitted by the tools u

#### Component Inception
- Team assigned 
- Owner assigned 
- Git repo created
- BitBucket added
- Component manifesto with purpose added

#### Feature life cycle (CI/CD - I)
- Features created
- Requirements written
- Test cases added
- Code deployed

####  Component Release life cycle (CI/CD - II)
- Build with build number
- SIT release - release notes and release number (version?)
- UAT release - release notes and release number (version?)
- Production release  - release notes and release number (version?)

#### Usage events
- Defects created in production
- Aha.io ideas coming in
- Data from business monitoring
