- BitBucket added
- Component manifesto with purpose added

#### Feature life cycle (CI/CD - I)
- Features created
- Requirements written
- Test cases added
- Code deployed

####  Component Release life cycle (CI/CD - II)
- Build with build number
- SIT release - release notes and release number (version?)
- UAT release - release notes and release number (version?)
- Production release  - release notes and release number (version?)
